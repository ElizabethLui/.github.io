# Bio

My name is Elizabeth Lui and I am currently working as a Researcher at the Computational Social Sciences and Legal Studies Lab, City University of Hong Kong.
I hold a Master's Degree in Comparative Social Policy at University of Oxford, and a Bachelor's Degree in Government and Public Administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
In this coming fall, I will be pursuing a MS degree in Data Science at the University of Texas at Austin (part-time, remotely).
As an aspiring computational social scientist, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python and R, and familiar with methods including Natural Languague Processing, 
social network theory, machine learning and so on. You may see my projects under the Portfolio Section below.

# Portfolio

# [Project #1 - Natural Language Processing - Distributed Methods](https://github.com/ElizabethLui/nlp_dask)

This project aims to conduct distributed data cleaning and wrangling processing on a huge dataset (the final dataset is comprised of 100+ million tweets). This set of codes can be leveraged and scaled to any project that involves memory-intensive tasks.

I crawled this dataset from scratch using the new Twitter API v2 via the twarc package.
